#+TITLE General packages
In this file we configure packages that should be avaliable in any Emacs 
buffer and major mode. They are listed in alphabetical order.

* Achievements ;-)

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package achievements
  :ensure t
  :config (achievements-mode t))
#+END_SRC

* Beacon
When you move point, the wave appears showing where it is.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package beacon
  :ensure t
  :config (beacon-mode t))
#+END_SRC
